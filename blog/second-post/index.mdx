There are many different dog breeds and for some people, it’s hard to differentiate between for example an [Alaskan Malamute vs. Siberian Husky](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/dog-breed-look-alikes/). With over 340 different breeds recognized by the [**Fédération Cynologique Internationale**](https://www.quora.com/How-many-breeds-of-dogs-exist)**.**

That's why we want to use deep learning to create a classifier that will help us with this task. For that, we will use [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#overview) or short for CNN which are very similar to standard Neural Networks. A CNN makes the assumption that the input is an Image and that certain aspects of that image will be encoded by the architecture of our Neural Network.

Besides creating a dog classifier in this project, we will also use the created Classification to classify human faces and their look-alike dog breed. We will structure this approach into X simple Steps.

Step 1: Downloading and Importing the Dataset.
----------------------------------------------

The [first dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip) consists of 13233 human images.

The [second dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip) consists of 8351 dog images.

After downloading and unzipping the datasets into your data folder we will create a function to load the dataset and create a train, valid and test files + target.

```
def load\_dataset(path):  
    data = load\_files(path)  
    dog\_files = np.array(data\['filenames'\])  
    dog\_targets = np\_utils.to\_categorical(np.array(data\['target'\]), 133)  
    return dog\_files, dog\_targets\# load train, test, and validation datasets  
train\_files, train\_targets = load\_dataset('path/to/yourdata/dog\_images/train')  
valid\_files, valid\_targets = load\_dataset('path/to/yourdata/dog\_images/valid')  
test\_files, test\_targets = load\_dataset('path/to/yourdata/dog\_images/test')
```

After creating our function we have 6680 training images, 835 validation images and 836 test images from 133 total dog categories. Which leads to an 80/10/10 split.

**Step 2: Creating a Facedetector and Dogdetector with OpenCV.**
----------------------------------------------------------------

OpenCV is a library that provides hundreds of different computer vision algorithms. We will use the OpenCV [Haar feature-based cascade classifiers](http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html), to detect human faces. In the next step, we need to download the pre-trained face detectors stored on [Github](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades). We will use the frontal face haar cascade.

```
import cv2 \# extract pre-trained face detector  
face\_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('path\_to\_haarcascade\_xml/haarcascade\_frontalface\_alt.xml')
```

After downloading and creating our face\_cascade we want to create a Face Detector:

```
\# returns "True" if face is detected in image stored at img\_path  
def face\_detector(img\_path):  
    img = cv2.imread(img\_path)  
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR\_BGR2GRAY)  
    faces = face\_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)  
    return len(faces) > 0
```

After creating our face detector we need to create a dog detector. For that we will use ResNet-50 which is a pre-trained computer vision model for image classification.

```
from keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50\# define ResNet50 model  
ResNet50\_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')def dog\_detector(img\_path):  
    prediction = ResNet50\_predict\_labels(img\_path)  
    return ((prediction <= 268) & (prediction >= 151))
```

The following dog\_detector will output a label from the ResNet50 [dictionary](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a). Between the numbers 151 and 268 is a different dog category from ‘Border collie’ up to ‘Walker foxhound’.

Step 3: Create a CNN

For this part, we will create a CNN from Scratch only to get a better understanding of how a CNN works and architecture could look like. The first step is to transform our images into tensors.

```
def path\_to\_tensor(img\_path):  
    # loads RGB image as PIL.Image.Image type  
    img = image.load\_img(img\_path, target\_size=(224, 224))  
    # convert PIL.Image.Image type to 3D tensor with shape (224, 224, 3)  
    x = image.img\_to\_array(img)  
    # convert 3D tensor to 4D tensor with shape (1, 224, 224, 3) and return 4D tensor  
    return np.expand\_dims(x, axis=0)def paths\_to\_tensor(img\_paths):  
    list\_of\_tensors = \[path\_to\_tensor(img\_path) for img\_path in tqdm(img\_paths)\]  
    return np.vstack(list\_of\_tensors)#we need to divide every pixel in every image by 255.  
\# pre-process the data for Keras  
train\_tensors = paths\_to\_tensor(train\_files).astype('float32')/255  
valid\_tensors = paths\_to\_tensor(valid\_files).astype('float32')/255  
test\_tensors = paths\_to\_tensor(test\_files).astype('float32')/255
```

By dividing we scale the picture to the wanted size. After the preprocessing, we go now to creat our CNN.

```
model = Sequential()model.add(Conv2D(filters=16, kernel\_size=2, input\_shape=(224, 224, 3), activation='relu'))  
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool\_size=2, data\_format='channels\_last'))  
model.add(Conv2D(filters=32, kernel\_size=2, activation='relu'))  
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool\_size=2, data\_format='channels\_last'))  
model.add(Conv2D(filters=64, kernel\_size=2, activation='relu'))  
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool\_size=2, data\_format='channels\_last'))model.add(GlobalAveragePooling2D())model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='categorical\_crossentropy', metrics=\['accuracy'\])
```

We created a very simple model that uses a relu activation function at the end of each layer and MaxPooling. We use a cross-entropy function and rmsprop as an optimizer. We train this model for 25 epochs which should be enough for a first creation. Our model has an accuracy of 1.19% which is better than random guessing 133 different breeds.

Step 4: Transfer learning with Resnet to improve Accuracy
---------------------------------------------------------

As you might have guessed 1.19% accuracy isn’t that good for use in production that's why we will use ResNet and optimize it on our image dataset.

```
#Create the model  
Resnet50\_model = Sequential()  
Resnet50\_model.add(GlobalAveragePooling2D(input\_shape=(train\_ResNet\_50.shape\[1:\])))  
Resnet50\_model.add(Dense(133, activation='softmax'))  
Resnet50\_model.summary()
```

Compile the model:

```
Resnet50\_model.compile(loss='categorical\_crossentropy', optimizer='rmsprop')
```

Train the model:

```
checkpointer = ModelCheckpoint(filepath='saved\_models/weights.best.Resnet50.hdf5',   
                               verbose=1, save\_best\_only=True)  
Resnet50\_model.fit(train\_ResNet\_50, train\_targets,   
          validation\_data=(valid\_ResNet\_50, valid\_targets),  
          epochs=20, batch\_size=20, callbacks=\[checkpointer\], verbose=1)
```

After training and loading our best model we reached a test accuracy of 81.56%.

Step 5: Create our dog identifier app
-------------------------------------

```
def dog\_identification\_app(img\_path):  
      
    display(Image(img\_path,width=200,height=200))  
    breed = resnet50\_prediction\_breed(img\_path)  
    if dog\_detector(img\_path):  
        print("Hello, dog! You look like a {}\\n".format(breed))  
    elif face\_detector(img\_path):  
        print("Hello, human! You look like a {}\\n".format(breed))  
    else:  
        print("Uhmmm You are not a dog or a human! Can you please try another picture? THANKS")
```

The input is an image that gets first displayed and then it will check with our created dog\_detector if its a dog or a human. If our input image is neither a dog or a human it will return:

> Uhmmm You are not a dog or a human! Can you please try another picture? THANKS"

The above pictures showcase how our app works.

Conclusion and Outlook:
=======================

Training a CNN from Scratch can be done in minutes up to hours but possibly won’t satisfy our needs. Transfer learning is for most use cases like creating a dog classifier enough.

This was a pretty fun project creating a CNN from Scratch and using a simple Keras NN architecture to create an image classifier. The project performs pretty well if all parameters are good and the dog breed is in the CNN classifier.

There are enough points which can be improved for example:

*   the input image needs to show the front of a face but we could also use other face detection xmls from OpenCV to further improve our model.
*   We could also improve the preprocessing with transformers and improve the performance of the model.
*   Add options for the input image if you want a dog, cat, other animals look like.
*   Create a simple Web app with Flask on Heroku

[On my, GitHub](https://github.com/Lukas-Forst/DeepLearning/tree/master/DogBreed%20Classification) is also an approach with PyTorch with a different and more complex model architecture.

If you want to see all the steps for creating the project you can see them in the following [Git repository](https://github.com/Lukas-Forst/CapStoneProject-DogClassifier):

Both datasets are from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)
